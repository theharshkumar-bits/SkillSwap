## -- Why I Built This
As a computer science student, I constantly juggle learning multiple technologies—Java, SQL, JavaScript, etc. I wanted a simple, visual way to track **how much** I've actually mastered in each area, rather than just checking off a list.

I also realized that beginners (including myself) often get stuck asking *"What should I learn next?"*. So, I recently updated the app with a **Roadmap Generator** that suggests a step-by-step path for popular tech stacks.

This project was my way of mastering **DOM Manipulation** and **State Management** in JavaScript before moving on to heavy frameworks like React.

## ---- Key Features
* *** Interactive Progress Tracking:** Use sliders to update your skill level (0-100%).
* *** Dynamic Roadmap Generator:** Type in a skill (e.g., "Java", "React", "Python") and the app instantly generates a learning path + recommended resources.
* *** Auto-Save (LocalStorage):** I used the browser's LocalStorage so you don't lose your progress if you refresh or close the tab. No database required!
* *** Search & Filter:** Quickly find skills by category (Frontend, Backend, Database).
* *** Fully Responsive:** Built with Bootstrap so it looks great on mobile phones too.

##  Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Data Persistence:** Browser LocalStorage API

##  What I Learned
Building this project taught me a few core concepts:
1.  **DOM Manipulation:** How to create and inject HTML elements (like the cards and roadmap steps) dynamically using JavaScript.
2.  **JSON Handling:** How to structure data (the learning paths) in Objects and retrieve them efficiently.
3.  **UX Thinking:** I realized that just showing a list isn't enough; adding the "Roadmap" feature made the tool actually *useful* for users.

##  Future Plans
I am planning to improve this further by:
* Connecting it to a real backend (Spring Boot) to save user data permanently.
* Adding an authentication system so different users can have their own profiles.
* Using an external API (like OpenAI) to generate roadmaps for *any* skill, not just the ones I hardcoded.
